# Dotta System
- the greatest educational app for collages 😜
- Actually was my AP mini project based on [Moodle](https://github.com/moodle/moodle) and [Yekta](https://yekta.iut.ac.ir/)
## ⏬ Description
#### - This app was primarily made as a practice exercise; However, I have made an effort to enhance its quality. Please note that due to time constraints, some classes are not fully encapsulated. I endeavored to adhere to the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle, but there are areas in the code that are not yet optimized. For instance, certain loops should be terminated once the desired answer is reached. Nonetheless, the encapsulation of the Person class is fairly well-implemented. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to inquire.
